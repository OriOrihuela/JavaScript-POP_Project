# The wolf breed octopus
From time to time, usually between 8 and 10 at night, Mariano transforms into an elusive large octopus with a long white beard, what in 
Galicia we call a wolf-octopus.

On the one hand, Mariano is grateful for not suffering the typical lycanthropy of the Galicians. Instead of worrying about accidentally 
eating the next-door countryman, he worries not to end up in the pot on Tuesdays where there is an octopus fair in town. 
After several occasions in which he has woken up dazed and naked among the rocks of the beach, he has decided to close the doors of his 
house with a key and fill the bathtub with mussels from the estuary to be entertained when he transforms.

But Mariano is worried and wants to solve his problem. He suspects that there is something that triggers the transformation, since it does 
not happen every day. As he is a little nerdy, he decides to face the problem in a scientific way, recording in a diary what he does every 
day and noting if he transformed or not with one of his eight arms.

We will help you build a program through which you can collect the information you need in a data structure, and then apply an algorithm 
to find out which or which of the things you do (walk, see the turn, drink wine, etc.) It produces that it is transformed into octopus.
